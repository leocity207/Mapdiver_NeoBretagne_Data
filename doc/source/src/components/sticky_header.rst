Sticky Header
=============
The **Sticky Header** is a user interface element that remains fixed at the top of the page, ensuring important navigation components are always accessible, even as the user scrolls.

Structure
---------

The Sticky Header consists of three key components:

- **Left Section:** A **hamburger menu** that triggers a click event when selected.
- **Center Section:** A **search bar** that accepts a list of searchable elements and emits an event when an item is selected.
- **Right Section:** A **logo** that can be displayed for branding purposes.
